## Sprints
### Wednesday 20th September
### **AM**

**Sprint 1**
> Research 4-5 questions for the first question topic and add to quiz.JSON

<!-- > Split each category of quiz into separate HTML documents
- [ ] Copy basic template of index.html onto 7 new HTML files
- [ ] Add title of category
- [ ] Add quiz question template via inline javascript (linked in the footer of all pages) -->

> Add 7 categories/sections onto the homepage
- [ ] Add a unique id to each section tag which corresponds to the topic name in quiz.JSON
- [ ] Add title of topic to seciton (possibly dynamic?)

> Add identifier for each question page
- [ ] Use `<hidden>` tag for the name of the topic page which corresponds to the `topic` attribute in quiz.JSON

> Loop through each question in the topic and create a page for each.
- [ ] Add hidden class to all but the first question

> Add data-id tags, with the index of the question, to all questions

> Create a move function to move through the questions
- [ ] Take in the data-id of the current question and the data-id of the question to move to as a parameter
- [ ] Set boundaries between the first and the last - check for result being less than or greater than index of questions
- [ ] If index of 0, hide the previous button
- [ ] If on last, hide previous and next buttons
- [ ]  On a next click whilst on the last question, go to (unshow) results page (with data-id of last index + 1)
- [ ] On a valid move, add hidden class on the previous and remove it from the next question

> Add previous and next buttons
- [ ] Add previous button which calls move
- [ ] Add next button which calls move
- [ ] Each button can hold a value/data attribute signifying which is the current question (as questions are generated by JS) - **(else just use data-id tag on current question)**

**Sprint 2**
> Create template for end/results page
- [ ] Have the number of questions correct (possibly by a loop through the questions and check the answers - keeping a score).
- [ ] Alternative to that would be to add a data-correct tag to all that is correct and count.
- [ ] Add a reset button which calls the move function (last, 0)

> Ammend colour scheme of website

> Change JSON data variables

> Add all additional questions for the other topics to quiz.JSON
